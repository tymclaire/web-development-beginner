# Adding Event Listeners Exercise 2

## Instructions

The sample HTML file has an input field for user text and an empty ```<p>``` element where the input will be displayed dynamically.

Try:

- Task 1: Observe the Effect
  - Open the HTML file in the browser.
  - When you type into the input field, the text should be updated and dynamically displayed below.
  - Read the code to understand how it works. Note how keyup is used to listen for new characters being typed.
- Task 2: Display the number of characters typed
  - Create a div element in HTML.
  - Edit the JS code within the script tags
  - Hint: Use ```event.target.value.length``` to count characters.

The JavaScript Code will be inside `<script> </script>` tags
Edit the code within the script tags

## Running the Test

To test if your code is correct, open the HTML file in Chrome.
Now refresh the page!

Make sure the correct elements respond when input is typed in.
