# SPA Exercise 2

## Instructions

Remember the website you made in Modules 1 and 2? In this exercise, you will try turning that Multi-Page website into an SPA.

### Steps to Complete the Exercise

- Step 1: Prepare Your HTML
  - Instead of having multiple .html files, consolidate everything into a single index.html file.
  - Add a div where the content will change dynamically.
  - Use the index.html provided to get started
- Step 2: Add JavaScript for Routing
  - Now, create a script.js file that will handle navigation without reloading the page.
  - Use the script.js provided to get started
  - Add in the content from your previous work inside routes object in script.js
- Step 3: Add in Your Images and Styling
  - Copy over your images folder and CSS file
- Step 4: Test Your SPA
  - Open your index.html in a browser.
  - Click the Home, About, and Contact links.
  - Notice how the URL changes (#home, #about, etc.) without reloading the page.
  - Refresh the page while on a different section—your script should load the correct content.
