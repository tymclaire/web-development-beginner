# SPA Exercise 1

## Instructions

In this exercise, you will understand the fundamentals of building a simple SPA. You will gain hands-on experience with managing different views within a single HTML page. We won’t be going through most of the code because we will be learning SPAs using JavaScript frameworks instead later. Instead, let’s focus on how SPAs reload the correct content onto web documents

### Instructions for the Exercise

- Explore the HTML File:
  - Open the index.html file to see the basic structure of the SPA.
  - Notice the navigation links at the top that link to different views using hash-based URLs (#home, #about, #contact).
- Explore the JavaScript File:
  - Open the script.js file to see how the routing is handled.
  - The loadContent function is responsible for updating the main content area based on the current hash.
- Modify and Enhance:
  - Add another navigation link (e.g., #services) to the nav element in the HTML file.
  - Update the loadContent function in the JavaScript file to handle this new route.
  - Experiment by adding more views or modifying the existing content.
- Test the Application:
  - Open the index.html file in a web browser.
  - Click on the navigation links to switch between different views.
  - Ensure that the content updates dynamically without refreshing the page.
