# Implementing Form Submission Exercise 1

## Instructions

- Create a new .js file (e.g., formHandler.js)
- Move all the inline JavaScript code to this external file
- Link the external JavaScript file in the HTML using the ```<script src="formHandler.js"></script>``` tag

Try and open the HTML file in Chrome. It should work the same as before

## Running the Test

To test if your code is correct, open the HTML file in Chrome.
