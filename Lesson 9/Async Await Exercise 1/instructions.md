# Async Await Exercise 1

## Instructions

For this exercise, we will be changing an existing Promise function to the async/await syntax

We will be using fetch:

- The fetch function in JavaScript is used to make HTTP requests to servers, typically to retrieve or send data to a web API
- It's a powerful and flexible way to interact with resources over the network, such as JSON data, images, or other files

Task 1

- Try converting it to use async await instead!

### Expected Behavior

When the code runs, the console should display the data from the API

## Running the Test

To test if your code is correct, run the test with the following commands in terminal: ```node main.js```
