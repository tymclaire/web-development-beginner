# Promise Exercise 1

## Instructions

Modify the section of code in main.js

Task 1

- Let’s convert the previous Callback to a Promise function
- Comment and uncomment the appropriate parts of the code
- How does the Callback and Promise code differ?
- What are the advantages of Promise over Callback?
  - Error Handling: Promises allow for centralized error handling using the catch method
  - Scalability: Asynchronous code written with promises scales better than code using nested callbacks

### Expected Behavior

When the code runs, the console should display the following messages in order:

After a 3-second delay, ```Data fetched```

## Running the Test

To test if your code is correct, run the test with the following commands in terminal: ```node main.js```
